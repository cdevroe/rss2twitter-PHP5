h2. Notice!

p. This script no longer works for Twitter's API since they now force the use of OAuth. I will be updating this script to use OAuth in the future unless someone else would like to contribute that change.

h2. Description:

p. Grabs an RSS feed and updates a Twitter account with a link to any new post based on a specific category in Wordpress.

h2. Installation:

# Edit $feedUrl
# Edit $categoryToTwitter (e.g. 'Mobile photos' or '' for all)
# Edit $cachedir (must be writable)
# Edit $twitter with user/pass
# Copy to server.
# Set up cron job. Example: /usr/local/php5/bin/php   /path/to/script/rss2twitter.php

p. That's it!

h2. License:
